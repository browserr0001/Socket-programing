This is an advanced Python-based Secure Chat room. The project is entirely based on the Socket Progamming; done using Python. A server is set to the listening mode, with a specific IP Address and Port number (that can be edited in the script) and clients are made to connect to the server, after which they are promopted to enter a nickname. The messages are then broadcasted to all the clients present. 

### ðŸ‘‰ Introduction

#### ðŸ‘‰ Sockets
<b> Sockets </b> and the socket API are used to send messages across a network. They provide a form of inter-process communication (IPC). The network can be a logical, local network to the computer, or one thatâ€™s physically connected to an external network, with its own connections to other networks. The obvious example is the Internet, which you connect to via your ISP. <br><br>

## ðŸ‘‰ Usage

1. We will have to start our Server first.
``` shell
Python Server.py
```
<b>Note: </b> Before running the server, make sure to edit the IP address and Port number. By default it is running on Localhost:5555 <br><br>
2. Run the Client file, to start the conversation. 
``` Shell
Python Client.py
```
<br>
3. Now Enter a nickname and start your chatting.
